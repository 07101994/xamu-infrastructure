### Adding Samples and Tests

We welcome samples and unit tests which show off how to use a feature in the library. When submitting a sample, we prefer that:

- The sample be small and self-contained.
- Show off a specific class or set of related classes.
- Be well commented to explain what is happening.

You can add samples to the [samples](samples) folder.

### New Functionality

We also welcome new functionality and classes! Make sure to include some documentation for any new classes or functionality added. It's also helpful to submit unit tests or some sort of sample to show off how to use the new feature/functionality.
